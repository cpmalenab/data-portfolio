I am a graduate student currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at De La Salle University. My journey into the world of data science stems from a profound curiosity about how we can harness the power of data to drive actionable insights into groundbreaking innovations. With a solid foundation in data processing, mathematics, and data visualization, I am equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle complex data challenges head-on.

Outside of my academic and professional work, staying physically and mentally active has been my escape. You’ll often catch me enjoying riding my bike on off-road terrains away from the city or engaging in competitive board game sessions with friends and family. Whether it's cycling through rugged landscapes or strategizing my next board game move, I bring the same level of enthusiasm to everything I do.

As I continue to expand my knowledge and expertise in data science, I am eager to explore new opportunities and collaborate with like-minded data enthusiasts. Don’t hesitate to reach out as I always look forward for opportunities to exchange ideas and make meaningful contributions.
